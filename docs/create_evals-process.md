# Create Evals for a Skill

STARTER_CHARACTER = 🧪

## Description

Evaluate a Claude Code skill's quality by running it against test prompts and measuring results. Uses Anthropic's skill-creator infrastructure from `docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-creator/`.

This process covers two types of evaluation:
- Quality evals: Does Claude follow the skill's instructions and produce good output?
- Trigger evals: Does the skill activate when it should and stay quiet when it shouldn't?

## Prerequisites

Run `./update-docs` to fetch the latest skill-creator infrastructure. The eval scripts, grader agents, and HTML viewer all live in `docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-creator/`.

## Steps

### 1. Write Test Prompts

Write 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say when they need this skill. Not abstract descriptions, but concrete requests with context, file names, specifics.

Bad: `"Process this data"`
Good: `"I have a CSV in ~/reports/q4-sales.csv with columns for region, revenue, and headcount. Can you add a profit-margin percentage column?"`

Save to `evals/evals.json` inside the skill directory:

```json
{
  "skill_name": "skill-name-here",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "The realistic user prompt",
      "expected_output": "Plain description of what success looks like",
      "files": []
    }
  ]
}
```

If the skill needs input files for testing, place them in `evals/files/` and reference them in the `files` array.

Schema reference: `docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-creator/references/schemas.md`

### 2. Draft Assertions

For each test prompt, write assertions — verifiable statements about what the output should contain or how Claude should behave. Add them to the `expectations` array in `evals/evals.json`.

Think about assertions in these categories:

- Correctness: Does the output contain the right information? ("The summary includes all three key findings from the source document")
- Completeness: Is anything missing? ("Every section from the template appears in the output")
- Format: Does the output match the expected shape? ("The output is a valid JSON file with a 'results' array")
- Behavior: Did Claude follow the skill's workflow? ("The skill's validation script was executed before producing final output")

Write assertions that are hard to satisfy without actually doing the work correctly. An assertion like "output file exists" is too weak — a wrong file still passes. Better: "output file contains column headers matching the input schema."

The grader agent will also critique weak assertions and suggest improvements, so the first draft doesn't need to be perfect.

### 3. Run Quality Evals

For each test prompt, spawn two subagents in the same turn:

**With-skill run**: Claude has access to the skill and executes the test prompt. Save outputs to `{skill-name}-workspace/iteration-1/eval-{ID}/with_skill/outputs/`.

**Baseline run**: Same prompt, no skill loaded. Save to `{skill-name}-workspace/iteration-1/eval-{ID}/without_skill/outputs/`.

Running both shows whether the skill actually adds value vs what Claude can do on its own.

While runs execute, write an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case:
```json
{
  "eval_id": 1,
  "eval_name": "descriptive-name",
  "prompt": "The user's task prompt",
  "assertions": ["assertion 1", "assertion 2"]
}
```

When each subagent completes, capture timing data from the task notification (`total_tokens`, `duration_ms`) and save to `timing.json` in the run directory. This data is only available at notification time.

### 4. Grade and Review

Once all runs complete:

**Grade**: For each run, use the grader agent protocol from `docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-creator/agents/grader.md`. The grader evaluates each assertion against the outputs, extracts and verifies claims, and critiques the assertions themselves. Save results to `grading.json`.

For assertions that can be checked programmatically (file exists, contains expected string, valid JSON), write and run a script instead of having the grader eyeball it.

**Aggregate**: Run the benchmark aggregation:
```bash
python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark {workspace}/iteration-1 --skill-name {name}
```
(Run from the `docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-creator/` directory.)

This produces `benchmark.json` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration (with_skill vs without_skill), including mean ± stddev.

**Analyze**: Review benchmark data for patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See `docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-creator/agents/analyzer.md` for what to look for — non-discriminating assertions, high-variance evals, time/token tradeoffs.

**Launch the viewer**:
```bash
python docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-creator/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \
  {workspace}/iteration-1 \
  --skill-name "{name}" \
  --benchmark {workspace}/iteration-1/benchmark.json
```

The viewer has two tabs:
- Outputs: browse each test case, see the output, leave feedback
- Benchmark: quantitative comparison between with-skill and baseline

Tell the user to review and come back when done.

### 5. Improve and Re-run

Read `feedback.json` from the viewer. Empty feedback means the output was fine. Focus on test cases where the user had complaints.

When improving the skill based on feedback:
- Generalize from the examples — the skill will be used on many prompts, not just these
- Read the transcripts, not just outputs — if Claude wasted time on unproductive steps, trim the instructions causing it
- Explain *why* behind instructions rather than rigid MUSTs

Re-run all test cases into `iteration-2/`, including baselines. For iteration 2+, pass `--previous-workspace` to the viewer so the user can compare versions.

Loop until the user is satisfied or feedback is all empty.

**Blind A/B comparison (optional)**: If you've iterated a few times and it's unclear whether the latest version is actually better, offer a blind comparison. This gives two outputs to an independent judge without revealing which version produced them. The judge scores on a rubric (correctness, completeness, organization, usability) and picks a winner. Then an analyzer explains *why* the winner won and suggests targeted improvements.

This is worth the extra time when improvement is ambiguous. Skip it when regular evals already show clear direction.

Protocol: `docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-creator/agents/comparator.md` and `docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-creator/agents/analyzer.md`.

### 6. Optimize Description (optional)

After the skill's quality is solid, offer to optimize the description for better triggering accuracy. The description is what Claude uses to decide whether to activate the skill.

**Generate trigger eval queries**: Create 20 queries — a mix of should-trigger (8-10) and should-not-trigger (8-10).

Should-trigger queries: different phrasings of the same intent, casual and formal, some where the user doesn't name the skill but clearly needs it.

Should-not-trigger queries: near-misses that share keywords but need something different. These are the valuable ones. `"Write a fibonacci function"` as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy. Better: a query that touches on a related domain but actually needs a different tool.

All queries should be realistic — include file paths, personal context, abbreviations, typos, mixed case. Not abstract one-liners.

**Review with user**: Present the queries for review. The user can edit, add, remove, toggle should/shouldn't trigger.

**Run optimization**: The optimization loop splits queries 60% train / 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (3 runs per query), proposes improvements using extended thinking, and iterates up to 5 times:

```bash
python -m scripts.run_loop \
  --eval-set {path-to-trigger-eval.json} \
  --skill-path {path-to-skill} \
  --model {model-id} \
  --max-iterations 5 \
  --verbose
```
(Run from the `docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-creator/` directory.)

Best description is selected by test score (not train score) to avoid overfitting.

**Apply**: Update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter with the best description. Show the user before/after with scores.

## Output

Eval files are saved inside the skill directory:
```
skill-name/
  SKILL.md
  evals/
    evals.json
    files/        (input files for testing, if needed)
  ...
```

Workspace directories (`{skill-name}-workspace/`) are working artifacts — they can be deleted after iteration is complete.
